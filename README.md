Discord Raidkit is an open-source, forever free tool that allows you to raid and destroy Discord servers via Discord bots, compromise Discord accounts, and generate Discord token grabbers.

![Discord Raidkit v2.4.2 Console](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98130822/235321378-f624a5ba-5ff6-4f80-b37e-8a1691724c53.png)

## Tools

- **Anubis** is a Discord bot with [nine malicious commands](#malicious-bot-commands). However, unlike other nuking tools, Anubis also has several non-malicious slash commands, including a moderation suite, to help you convince server administration to add the bot.

- **Qetesh** is a Discord bot with [nine malicious commands](#malicious-bot-commands). However, Qetesh also has 25 NSFW slash commands for the most popular pornographic kinks, at least according to PornHub. These commands should help take advantage of the degeneracy of Discord users.

- **Osiris** is the account manager of Discord Raidkit. Using Osiris, you can save the information of an account, login to an account using either Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge, or you can fully nuke an account, deleting channels, guilds, friends, and connections, deauthorizing applications, removing hype squad, and PATCHing various account settings. You can also generate Discord token grabbers within Windows Registry support. As of v2.4.2, Osiris supports proxies (**proxies currently beta; awaiting feedback**).
 
## Installation

1. Head over to [the latest release](https://github.com/the-cult-of-integral/discord-raidkit/releases/latest).
2. Download the EXE zip.
3. Extract and run the executable in its directory.
